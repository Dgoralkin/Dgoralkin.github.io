## I. Self-Introduction  

After completing three and a half years in the Computer Science program, focusing on data and software engineering, I have been exposed to various programming languages and developed a strong mindset to solve complex problems.  

While in the program, I learned to think outside the box and always consider the interaction between the user and the software—such as the safety and security of the software, the functionality, and the design—and how easy and intuitive it will be for users to operate the software.  

I also learned to think beyond the lines of code I wrote and consider the other developers who will maintain my code by following best practices and crediting others’ work. Ultimately, I learned that everything is possible and the sky is the limit. If there is something I can’t solve today, it doesn’t mean it’s not solvable—it means there is a new skill I must learn and develop to tackle and solve the problem.  

Throughout the enhancements, I will demonstrate my ability to develop functional code by applying modern software design principles, such as object-oriented programming, and following best practices. I will also demonstrate my skills in designing and testing computing solutions using algorithms while outlining trade-offs in my design decisions. Similarly, I will demonstrate a security-focused mindset that minimizes threats, identifies and mitigates design flaws, and ensures the privacy and safety of data.  

To achieve these goals, I will use proven and innovative computing tools and techniques to meet industry standards and adapt to the audience and context.  

These skills will help me succeed as a full-stack developer—working individually or collaboratively in teams focused on quality, functionality, and security. My ability to design functional front-ends, manage structured back-end databases, and integrate them effectively will be an asset across industries such as banking, healthcare, and entertainment.  

While this is only a cornerstone in my journey to become an expert AI developer, developing full-stack skills and expanding my knowledge into advanced designs and implementations is an essential first step.
