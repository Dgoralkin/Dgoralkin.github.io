## I. Self-Introduction  

After completing three and a half years in the Computer Science program, focusing on data and software engineering, I have been exposed to various programming languages and developed a strong mindset to solve complex problems.  

While in the program, I learned to think outside the box and always consider the interaction between the user and the software—such as the safety and security of the software, the functionality, and the design—and how easy and intuitive it will be for users to operate the software.  

I also learned to think beyond the lines of code I wrote and consider the other developers who will maintain my code by following best practices and crediting others’ work. Ultimately, I learned that everything is possible and the sky is the limit. If there is something I can’t solve today, it doesn’t mean it’s not solvable—it means there is a new skill I must learn and develop to tackle and solve the problem.  

Throughout the enhancements, I will demonstrate my ability to develop functional code by applying modern software design principles, such as object-oriented programming, and following best practices. I will also demonstrate my skills in designing and testing computing solutions using algorithms while outlining trade-offs in my design decisions. Similarly, I will demonstrate a security-focused mindset that minimizes threats, identifies and mitigates design flaws, and ensures the privacy and safety of data.  

To achieve these goals, I will use proven and innovative computing tools and techniques to meet industry standards and adapt to audience and context.  

These skills will help me succeed as a full-stack developer—working individually or collaboratively in teams focused on quality, functionality, and security. My ability to design functional front-ends, manage structured back-end databases, and integrate them effectively will be an asset across industries such as banking, healthcare, and entertainment.  

While this is only a cornerstone in my journey to become an expert AI developer, developing full-stack skills and expanding my knowledge into advanced designs and implementations is an essential first step.

## IV. Enhancement Plan  

---

### **Category One: Software Engineering and Design**

The artifact to be enhanced under the **Software Engineering and Design** category is the *Travlr mid-course project milestone* from the CS-465 Full Stack Development class.  

The project will be redesigned with a **mobile-first approach** to fit both desktop and mobile devices. New functionalities will include:  
- User account creation  
- Two-step authentication  
- User login  
- Cart functionality for booking and order management  

#### Enhancement Steps:
1. **Redesign the layout** for intuitive mobile usability, improving the overall design and professionalism.  
2. **Add B2C functionality** so users can book travel packages directly through the website.  
3. **Implement login and authentication systems** with two-step verification (2SV).  
4. **Migrate the database** from a local instance to a cloud platform (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).  
5. **Test and deploy** the platform using modern tools for production access.  

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Updating software architecture  
- Implementing authentication  
- Managing cloud database migration  
- Applying secure, scalable, and modern design practices  

#### Aligned Course Outcomes:
- Apply innovative tools and techniques to deliver value and meet industry goals.  
- Develop a security mindset to identify vulnerabilities and protect user data.

### **Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The second enhancement continues using the **Travlr project** as the base artifact.  

The goal is to transform the website into an **intelligent platform** using algorithms to optimize performance, search, and filtering.  

#### Enhancement Steps:
1. Implement **server-side indexing** and optimized queries in MongoDB for faster searches.  
2. Develop **filtering algorithms** that combine multiple criteria (destination, price, rating, etc.).  
3. Enhance responsiveness and user experience through algorithmic efficiency.  

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Implementing optimized search and filtering algorithms  
- Applying algorithmic principles to solve practical problems  
- Communicating technical results clearly to end users  

#### Aligned Course Outcomes:
- **Outcome 3:** Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles.  
- **Outcome 4:** Use innovative tools and techniques to deliver professional, industry-level functionality.

### **Category Three: Databases**

The Travlr artifact currently uses a local database, which limits collaboration and scalability.  
This enhancement focuses on migrating the database to a **cloud platform** such as MongoDB Atlas or Amazon RDS.  

#### Enhancement Steps:
1. **Create and configure** a MongoDB Atlas account with role-based access controls.  
2. **Migrate existing data** from the local database to the cloud.  
3. **Build a secure RESTful API** connecting the front-end to the new database.  
4. **Enable collaboration** for admins and analysts using tools like Power BI or Tableau.  

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Designing and deploying modern databases  
- Managing trade-offs in scalability and usability  
- Enabling secure, collaborative workflows  

#### Aligned Course Outcomes:
- **Outcome 1:** Build collaborative environments for diverse audiences to support decision-making.  
- **Outcome 4:** Use innovative computing tools to create value and achieve industry goals.
