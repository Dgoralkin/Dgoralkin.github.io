#1️⃣-self-introduction  

After completing three and a half years in the Computer Science program, focusing on data and software engineering, I have been exposed to various programming languages, architectures, designs, and execution environments, and have developed a strong mindset for solving complex problems and meeting deadlines.
While in the program, I learned at night and worked full-time as a service manager while being a father to three wonderful kids. But most importantly, I learned to think outside the box and always consider the interaction between the user and the software—such as the user's safety and security, functionality, and design—and how easy and intuitive it will be for users to operate the software.  

Additionally, I learned to think beyond the code I wrote and to consider the other developers who will maintain it, following best practices and crediting others' work. Ultimately, I learned that everything is possible and the sky is the limit. If there is something I can't solve today, it doesn't mean it's not solvable—it means I need to learn and develop new skills to solve the problem.
Throughout the enhancements, I will demonstrate my ability to develop functional code by applying modern software design principles, such as object-oriented programming, and following best practices. I will also demonstrate my skills in designing and testing computing solutions using algorithms while outlining trade-offs in my design decisions. Similarly, I will demonstrate a security-focused mindset that minimizes threats, identifies and mitigates design flaws, and ensures the privacy and safety of data.  

To achieve these goals, I will use proven and innovative computing tools and techniques to meet industry standards and adapt to the audience and context.  
These skills will help me succeed as a full-stack developer—working individually or collaboratively, with a focus on quality, functionality, and security. My ability to design functional front-end interfaces, manage structured back-end databases, and integrate them effectively will be an asset across industries such as banking, healthcare, entertainment, and more.  
While this is only a cornerstone in my journey to become an expert AI developer, developing full-stack skills and expanding my knowledge into advanced design and implementation are essential first steps. I am looking forward to entering the computer science workplace and mastering my skills by applying everything I have learned on my journey while keeping my mind open to learning from the best in the field.

With this in mind,  what started as a professional hobby project soon became the next thing I wanted to do in life. Looking forward, I have already started planning my path towards the Master's degree, focusing on ML and deep learning.
But for now, completing my coursework throughout the program taught me to plan my work by choosing the right development strategy for the task, whether it be a Waterfall, Agile model, or DevOps, reading and creating diagrams, or simply communicating my work to stakeholders or an expert audience.
For example, I had the chance to play the role of the Scrum master and the project manager in one course, and a tester and developer in the other. Similarly, I had the chance to create detailed design diagrams for my colleagues to develop and execute a development based on the given diagrams and requirements. All that while collaborating with my team and keeping best practices in mind.

Eventually, the program did not teach me to "just write code," but to think like a state-of-the-art software developer who sees the big picture, from collecting user stories to clean deployment, project summary, and assessment. I had the chance to practise multiple programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, including running queries and building relational and non-relational databases as MySQL and MongoDB, I had the chance to practise as a data analyst while scraping and cleaning code using the R language, while communicating the findings and providing visualized recommendation plans using Power BI, Tableu, or Knime. As well as working with RESTful APIs and developing software for Android mobile devices. Ultimately, I had the chance to build several full-stack applications using Maven, Node and Python libraries. In addition, I practised in developing an AI agent and studied the technology behind ML and DL, as well as modelled and executed a picture-based scenario into a computerized 3D navigation environment.

The end result? Combining my freshly acquired skills with my previous knowledge and 14 years of experience as a self-employed and founder of a small-sized company, I feel comfortable holding both sides of the sword and being a solo software developer, as well as a meaningful team leader who drives his team to success by acting as a role model!
To demonstrate my skills, I chose to enhance the "Travlr" full-stack app developed from my CS-465 coursework by demonstrating mastery in Software design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data structures, and Databases.

### To do so, I will:
- ✅ **1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making.**
- ✅ **2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts**
- ✅ **3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices**
- ✅ **4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals**
- ✅ **5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources**

## 5️⃣. Enhancement Plan  

---

### 📌**Category One: Software Engineering and Design**

The artifact to be enhanced under the **Software Engineering and Design** category is the *Travlr mid-course project milestone* from the CS-465 Full Stack Development class.  

The project will be redesigned with a **mobile-first approach** to fit both desktop and mobile devices. New functionalities will include:  
- User account creation  
- Two-step authentication  
- User login  
- Cart functionality for booking and order management  

#### Enhancement Steps:
1. **Redesign the layout** for intuitive mobile usability, improving the overall design and professionalism.  
2. **Add B2C functionality** so users can book travel packages directly through the website.  
3. **Implement login and authentication systems** with two-step verification (2SV).  
4. **Migrate the database** from a local instance to a cloud platform (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).  
5. **Test and deploy** the platform using modern tools for production access.  

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Updating software architecture  
- Implementing authentication  
- Managing cloud database migration  
- Applying secure, scalable, and modern design practices  

#### Aligned Course Outcomes:

- **Outcome 4:** Apply innovative tools, techniques, and skills to deliver value and meet industry goals.  
- **Outcome 1:** Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences.

#### **Narratives:**

- Building this project half a year ago was my first experience working with JavaScript and RESTful API. Although I already have some experience with databases running on a local machine, it seemed to me so outdated to build a modern software upon “old” technology, hence moving to the cloud and benefiting from scaling, security, and the added value of data analysis that could be done in the cloud was a cornerstone in choosing that artifact.
- While enhancing the original project and taking the lead over the development, I practiced and improved my skills in JavaScript, delved deeper into working with CSS, HTML, and Handlebars, implemented a modern and remote database from scratch, and created separate user roles to improve security, collaboration, and functionality.
- Beyond the technical aspect, I also implemented best practices in coding by making the code more readable, modular and maintainable by splitting it into separate code files, re-organizing the files for easier navigation and improved logic
- Accomplishing the above allowed me to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools to implement computer solutions that deliver value and achieve industry-specific goals, and to employ a collaborative environment to address diverse audiences and support decision-making in the field of computer science.
- The enhancement process itself, once again, reminded me of the value of creating and following a well-written development plan, adhering to a dedicated timeline, and splitting complex work into smaller development blocks that will work in harmony to form the complete picture. With that said, the work on this project allowed me to expand my skills by learning another programming language, improving my UX/UI development skills, and using and implementing modern technologies, such as MongoDB Atlas for data storage and Postman for testing my code's functionality.

### 📌**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The second enhancement continues using the **Travlr project** as the base artifact.  

The goal is to transform the website into an **intelligent platform** using algorithms to optimize performance, search, and filtering.  

#### Enhancement Steps:
1. Implement **server-side indexing** and optimized queries in MongoDB for faster searches.  
2. Develop **filtering algorithms** that combine multiple criteria (destination, price, rating, etc.).  
3. Enhance responsiveness and user experience through algorithmic efficiency.  

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Implementing optimized search and filtering algorithms  
- Applying algorithmic principles to solve practical problems  
- Communicating technical results clearly to end users  

#### Aligned Course Outcomes:
- **Outcome 3:** Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  
- **Outcome 5:** Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits and mitigates design flaws to ensure privacy and enhanced security.  

#### **Narratives:**
- I have selected algorithms and event listeners that will be responsible for updating the elements via dedicated and modular JavaScript code sections, making the app dynamic and vibrant.
- I rebuilt my database and added more tables to hold data while considering speed, functionality and storage in mind.
- Rewrote my queries into compound ones, which resulted in a faster response rate by minimizing the need to sort data on the client/server, since it can be retrieved, sorted, and filtered directly from the database.
- Despite adding more complexity to the database and the development and testing process, it allowed me to save storage space, increase efficiency, and develop an encapsulated, robust data structure.
- This practice and enhancement helped me develop well-founded, innovative techniques and skills, and to use existing libraries to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
- Another solved challenge in this enhancement was creating the cart logic and functionality from scratch, as well as managing sessions and authentications. During the testing phase, I found that the architecture I used left my data traversing the web insecure and vulnerable to cross-scripting and hijacking, as it was improperly created and stored on the server and wasn’t encrypted.
- To achieve and develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources, I had to rewrite the logic and the architecture to protect the data and create encapsulation for each user.
- Established timed data sessions, which will sign out inactive users, and created private user tokens to instantiate privacy and security while isolating sensitive user information and wrapping it in a protection layer.

### 📌**Category Three: Databases**

The Travlr artifact currently uses a local database, which limits collaboration and scalability.  
This enhancement focuses on migrating the database to a **cloud platform** such as MongoDB Atlas or Amazon RDS.  

#### Enhancement Steps:
1. **Create and configure** a MongoDB Atlas account with role-based access controls.  
2. **Migrate existing data** from the local database to the cloud.  
3. **Build a secure RESTful API** connecting the front-end to the new database.  
4. **Enable collaboration** for admins and analysts using tools like Power BI or Tableau.  

#### Skills Demonstrated:
- Designing and deploying modern databases  
- Managing trade-offs in scalability and usability  
- Enabling secure, collaborative workflows  

#### Aligned Course Outcomes:
- **Outcome 4:** Apply innovative tools, techniques, and skills to deliver value and meet industry goals. 
- **Outcome 5:** Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits and mitigates design flaws to ensure privacy and enhanced security. 

#### **Narratives:**
- I first created a new account in Atlas and defined limited user role permissions for my app to talk to the database as a measure of precaution and security. This practice will ensure that app users have access to the database without risking exposure to other sensitive data or harming it.
- I have rebuilt my database and added more tables to hold data, while keeping speed, functionality, and storage in mind. To accomplish the above-mentioned, I had to rewrite my queries into compound ones, which resulted in a faster response rate by minimizing the need to sort data on the client/server, since it can be retrieved, sorted, and filtered directly from the database.
- Despite adding more complexity to the database and the development and testing process, it allowed me to save storage space, increase efficiency, and develop an encapsulated, robust data structure.
- While security was in mind, I had to secure my exposed API endpoints to the database against unauthorized use. Therefore, I secured all my endpoints with HttpOnly and strict cookies to provide the best defence against CSRF and cross-site scripting.
- In addition to ensuring that my users' data is secure, I implemented a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authenticator during registration and login to minimize the risk of breaches and data theft.
- Ultimately, I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
